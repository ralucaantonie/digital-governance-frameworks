# Digital Governance Frameworks  
Documentation, validation models and workflows used in EU and UN digital transformation projects.

## About this repository
This repository contains structured materials that reflect my work in **multi-stakeholder digital implementation**, **compliance validation**, **interoperability assessment**, and **secure workflow documentation** across European and international projects.

While not focused on software development, the repository includes practical frameworks relevant to the architecture, validation and coordination of complex digital systems.

## Focus areas
- Digital governance models and structured implementation steps  
- System validation frameworks and compliance checks  
- Secure authentication and transaction workflow documentation  
- Interoperability principles used across EU digital ecosystems  
- Multi-stakeholder coordination and issue-resolution processes  
- Readiness assessment and structured scenario planning  

## Why this repository exists
In the international projects I coordinate (EU, UN, Horizon Europe), a significant part of the work involves:
- validating digital platforms,  
- ensuring alignment with EU interoperability standards,  
- documenting workflows and decision pathways,  
- mapping risks and compliance requirements,  
- coordinating institutions through structured verification phases.

This repository summarizes this experience in an accessible, technical format.
