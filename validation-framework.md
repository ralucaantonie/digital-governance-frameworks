- Support readiness for further integration or cross-institutional use.

## 2. Actors & Stakeholders
- Institutional partners
- Technical providers
- Governance & administrative units
- End-users / test participants
- Compliance & evaluation teams

## 3. Validation Steps
### Environment Preparation
- Access provisioning
- Dataset preparation
- Scenario configuration

### Workflow Mapping
- Identify key paths, decision points, and dependencies

### Scenario Execution
- Normal flow execution
- Alternative flows
- Error-handling and exceptions

### Evidence Collection
- Screenshots, logs, notes, observations
- Deviations and unexpected behaviours

## 4. Reporting
- Summary of results
- Observations and deviations
- Recommendations
- Follow-up actions and timeline
